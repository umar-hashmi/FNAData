# FNAData

This repository contains two feeders of the Non-synthetic European low voltage test system used for the Flexibility analysis.
 
## Original dataset

The original dataset consists of a full Low voltage network of sub-urban region with 30 transformers, 160 feeders, 10290 nodes and 8087 consumers, with load profiles of 20 days from actual smart-meter.
The paper is available in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061519318836

and the link for full data-set: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/685vgp64sm/1

For the original networks, the line impedance is specified 4x4 matrice without mutual impedance. 

This repository however, contains three-wire and four-wire extensions of the original feeders with and without mutual impedences.
